## What's this

This is a small remote code execution engine I started working on in the beginning of 2024, which evolved from simply being a coding sandbox to a platform that will allow users to solve algorithmic problems (like Leetcode)

- [ ] Improve error handling of the executor
- [ ] Isolate the stout and stderr of each test case (idk how)
